# 2.1 Arrays and Tuples

In this blog post, we'll explore two fundamental data structures in TypeScript: Arrays and Tuples. Arrays allow us to store multiple values in a single variable, while Tuples provide a way to represent a collection of values with different types. By understanding these data structures, you'll be able to store and manipulate collections of values more effectively in your TypeScript applications.

## Arrays in TypeScript

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. In TypeScript, you can specify the type of elements the array can hold. You can define arrays in two ways:

Using the square brackets \[]:

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let names: string[] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

```

Using the Array generic type:

```typescript
let numbers: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let names: Array<string> = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

```

You can use various array methods to manipulate the data in the array, such as push, pop, splice, map, filter, reduce, and more. Here's an example:

```typescript
let fruits: string[] = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

// Add an element to the end of the array
fruits.push("Orange");

// Remove the last element from the array
fruits.pop();


// Iterate over the array using forEach
fruits.forEach((fruit) => console.log(fruit));

// Create a new array with all elements converted to uppercase
let fruitsUppercase: string[] = fruits.map((fruit) => fruit.toUpperCase());

```

## Tuples in TypeScript

Tuples are a way to represent a collection of values with different types. In TypeScript, you can define the types of elements in a tuple, and the order of the types matters. Here's how to define a tuple:

```typescript
let person: [string, number] = ["Alice", 30];

```

In this example, the person tuple has a string as its first element and a number as its second element. Accessing the elements works the same way as in arrays, using the index:

```typescript
let name: string = person[0]; // "Alice"
let age: number = person[1]; // 30

```

Keep in mind that the length of a tuple is fixed and determined by the number of elements in the type definition. You can also use optional elements and default values in tuples:

```typescript
// Optional element
let personWithOptionalPhone: [string, number, string?] = ["Alice", 30, "555-1234"];

// Default values
let personWithDefaultPhone: [string, number, string] = ["Alice", 30, "555-0000"];

```

## Conclusion

That's a brief introduction to Arrays and Tuples in TypeScript. These are fundamental data structures used to store and manipulate collections of values. By understanding how to work with Arrays and Tuples, you'll be able to develop more efficient and readable TypeScript applications. Happy coding!
